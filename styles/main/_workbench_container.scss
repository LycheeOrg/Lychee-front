 * The workbench shares horizontal space with the right sidebar.

 * workbench a flex item.
 * The workbench holds the the view container and the footer
 * and aligns them vertically in a column.
 * The footer has its natural height, the remaining vertical space is filled
 * by the view container.
 * However, view container may grow vertically as much its content requires.
 * Hence, the workbench provides a scrollbar in vertical direction.
