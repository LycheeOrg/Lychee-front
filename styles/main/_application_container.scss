/**
 * The application container is a child of the body and shares the vertical
 * space of the body with the loading indicator.
 * The body uses `dispay: flex` thus making the application container a flex
 * item.
 * The application container holds the left menu and the workbench container
 * and aligns them horizontally in a row.
 * The left menu has always its natural width (0 for a closed menu,
 * specific width for an open menu), the width of the workbench
 * container is flexible and uses the remaining width.
